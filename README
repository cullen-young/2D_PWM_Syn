Code and Directories used to generate synthetic plane-wave migration images from the SEG/EAGE Overthrust model. 

Data is generated using data/SConstruct. 

This data is passed into data_prep/SConstruct to apply a linear time delay to the source (MS2P) and receiver (MR2P) data.

The time delayed data is passed into rtm/SConstruct which calls Mrtm2dGPU_DASVSP_CWM.cu to perform 2D Reverse Time Migration.
